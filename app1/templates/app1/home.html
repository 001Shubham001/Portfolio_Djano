                <p>I like Python because its Easy to learn and code </p>
                <p> 
                    Consistently, Python is ranking as one of the easiest programming languages to learn. 
                    This is due to its high reliability and simple syntax which is quite similar to plain text. 
                    So, you can write a Python code simply and execute it much faster than the other programming languages.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Django has a powerful template engine and its own markup language with many tools.
                    Templates are files with HTML code that's used to render data.</p>
